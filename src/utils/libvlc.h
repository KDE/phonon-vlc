/**
 * \brief Singleton class containing a libvlc instance.
 *
 * This class is a convenience class implementing the singleton pattern to hold
 * an instance of libvlc. This instance is necessary to call various libvlc
 * functions (such as creating a new mediaplayer instance).
 *
 * To initialize the object call init(), this will create the actualy LibVLC
 * instance and then try to initialize the libvlc instance itself.
 * init() returns false in case the libvlc instance could not be created.
 *
 * For convenience reasons there is also a libvlc macro which gets the LibVLC
 * instance and then the libvlc_instance_t form that. Note that this macro
 * does not check whether LibVLC actually got initialized, so it should only
 * be used when you can be absolutely sure that init() was already called
 *
 * \code
 * LibVLC::init(0); // init LibVLC
 * if (!LibVLC::self) {
 *     exit(1); // error if self is null
 * }
 * libvlc_media_player_new(libvlc); // use libvlc macro
 * \endcode
